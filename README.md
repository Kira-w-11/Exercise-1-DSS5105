# Exercise-1-DSS5105

This project is part of the DSS5105 Data Science course at the National University of Singapore. The project demonstrates the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development. It involves generating and visualizing a checkerboard pattern using Python.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python script that generates a checkerboard pattern of a specified size and visualizes it using the `matplotlib` library. It demonstrates the process of creating a version-controlled project using Git and GitHub, including resolving merge conflicts when collaborating on the same file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following dependencies:

- **numpy**: A package for numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: A package for plotting graphs and visualizations.

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install them manually using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kira-w-11/Exercise-1-DSS5105.git
   cd Exercise-1-DSS5105
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies** if you haven't done so already:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Python script** to generate and display the checkerboard pattern:

   ```bash
   python checkerboard.py
   ```

   This will generate a checkerboard pattern based on the specified size and number of squares, and display the result using `matplotlib`.

## Project Structure

- `checkerboard.py`: The main Python script that generates and visualizes the checkerboard.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project details and instructions on how to run it.
